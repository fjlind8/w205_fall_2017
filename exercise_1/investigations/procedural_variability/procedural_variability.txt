The hospitals with the greatest procedural variability are (#1 - #10)

IMM_3	Healthcare Personnel Influenza Vaccination
VTE_5	Venous Thromboembolism Warfarin Therapy Discharge Instructions
VTE_1	Venous Thromboembolism Prophylaxis
STK_8	Stroke Education
IMM_2	Influenza Immunization
HF_1	Discharge Instructions
HF_2	Evaluation of LVS Function
STK_6	Discharged on Statin Medication
PN_6	Initial Antibiotic Selection for CAP in Immunocompetent Patient
STK_1	Venous Thromboembolism (VTE) Prophylaxis

After creating the table using procedural_variability.sql, these results can be found using:
select
a.measure_id,
b.measure_name
from procedural_variability a
join measures_parquet b on a.measure_id = b.measure_id
;

To answer this question I only focused on the Effective Care data set because it has a wider range of procedures than the Readmissions and Deaths data set. The logic for this query was the same as for the best_hospitals and best_states questions in terms of the filtered out measures. I also added some logic to check that the measure had scores for at least 1000 hospitals (roughly 20% of all hospitals). This threshold was chosen rather arbitrarily but I felt 1000 was a good sample size to work with. Some measures were only calculated for less than 100 hospitals and I felt that was too small to compare to other hospitals.

I based my answer to this question on the variance of the score for a particular measure, where the largest variance means the most variability in a measure across hospitals.
