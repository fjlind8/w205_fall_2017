The states that are the best models of high-quality care are (#1 - #10):

CO
UT
SD
MD
NH
NE
NC
WI
DE
ME

After creating the table using best_states.sql, these results can be found using:
select
state
from best_states
;

The methodology used to calculate the best states was the same as it was for the best hospitals, except aggregated at the state level. I upped the measure count requirements to 30 for the Effective Care data and 10 for the Readmissions and Death data to ensure the highest quality of comparison across states. This criteria eliminates Guam (GU), New Jersey (NJ), and American Samoa (AS) from the set of states.
