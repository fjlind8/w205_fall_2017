The states that are the best models of high-quality care are (#1 - #10):

CO
UT
SD
MD
NH
NE
NC
WI
DE
ME

After creating the table using best_states.sql, these results can be found using:
select

from best_states
;

The methodology used to calculate the best states was the same as it was for the best hospitals, except aggregated at the state level.
