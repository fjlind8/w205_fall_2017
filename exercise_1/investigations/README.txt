Investigations

Each folder has a .sql file and a .txt file. The .sql file is used to generate the results shown in the .txt file, and the .txt file contains my analsis methodology. I only used the Effective Care and Readmissions and Deaths data for determining the best hospitals and states and procedural variability, as I knew the fourth question would tie in customer survey data.

The best_states.sql query is very similar to the best_states.sql file so I did not provide much additional commentary in best_states.txt.
