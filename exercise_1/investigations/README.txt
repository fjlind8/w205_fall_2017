Investigations

Each folder has a .sql file and a .txt file. The .sql file is used to generate the results shown in the .txt file, and the .txt file contains my analsis methodology.

The best_states.sql query is very similar to the best_states.sql file so I did not provide much additional commentary in best_states.txt.
