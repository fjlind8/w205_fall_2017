I began my analysis by looking at the different hospital types from the table hospitals. I noticed that Children's and VA hospitals occur much less frequently than Acute Care or Critical Care. When asked which hospitals provide the best care for patients, I could have grouped by hospital type, but a majority of citizens in the country are adult, non-Veterans, so my answers are tailored to the majority of the population.
